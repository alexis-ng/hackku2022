Lead carpenter with 8+ years of experience in residential and commercial construction. I can work with remodeling and repairs.
I have a bachelors degree in computer science and a masters degree in plumbing. I also have an MBA that I can use for stupid stuff and I am just making this stuff up.
I dont know what I am going to do with my degree but you are stupid enough to give me a carpenter job for a cs major but what I am trying to say is I am just testing out this wonderful program I just wrote.
What is a helpful line. I live in overland park and vinny is stupid.
